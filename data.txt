Deep learning is a subset of machine learning.
Transformers use self attention to process sequences.
Neural networks learn representations from data.
GPT models are trained using next token prediction.
Tokenization converts text into numbers.
Attention allows models to focus on relevant information.
Large language models require large datasets.
Training data quality matters more than quantity.
